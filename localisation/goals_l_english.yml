SWE_swedish_national_research_institute:0"Swedish National Research Institue"
SWE_swedish_national_research_institute_desc:0"For far too long our efforts in the military research department have been sporadic and not concentrated enough. It might be worth gathering the sharpest Swedish minds and streamlining our military R&D. Soon we shall lead the world—before taking it!"

SWE_rocketry_efforts:0"Swedish Rocket Program"
SWE_rocketry_efforts_desc:0"With supremacy of the mind and the skies, there is only one frontier left. The Swedish people have, for too long, stared at the Moon longingly. We must focus our efforts on reaching space, and beyond! And while we're at it, bomb some cities too."

SWE_national_defence_research_institute_desc:0"With a solid industrial and military backbone now in place, it's time for some exploration.

SWE_swedish_carriers:0"Swedish Carriers"
SWE_swedish_carriers_desc:0"His Majesty's navy has not seen a considerable increase in power for too long. Other nations around the world are surely bolstering their navies with fancy ships. Why can't we?"

SWE_extend_our_skies:0"Extend our Skies"
SWE_extend_our_skies_desc:0"Now with carriers of our own, we mustn't neglect our aerial capabilities. We should start retrofitting our plane models so that they may fly on these mighty new ships. No ship will be safe from the wrath of his Majesty's carrier fleet!"

SWE_destroyer_effort:0"Destroyer Efforts"
SWE_destroyer_effort_desc:0"We shall focus now on the meat of the fleet—the destroyers. They might take the brunt of the force at sea, so we should focus on producing them. Protect Swedish sovereignty!"

SWE_swedish_submarine_concentration:0"Swedish Submarine Focus"
SWE_swedish_submarine_concentration_desc:0"Our waters are perfect for submarine operations. We must take advantage of this and sink their ships from below. They won't know what hit them until the sea is up to their necks."

SWE_stronger_c_byran:0"Stronger C-Byrån"
SWE_stronger_c_byran_desc:0"The C-byrån, or C bureau, the swedish secret intelligence agency was recently founded in 1939 under the armed forces. The goals of our country and our people have since changed; we have been born anew! It might be prudent to integrate the C-byrån more with the army, and research relevant technologies for future operations."

SWE_operation_hoppa_hage:0"Operation Hoppa Hage"
SWE_operation_hoppa_hage_desc:0"The British Empire has long been a thorn in Sweden's side. We must get rid of them if we are to preserve our safety. Operation Hoppa Hage, or operation 'Hop Scotch' will do this."

SWE_operation_regnmoln:0"Operation Regnmoln"
SWE_operation_regnmoln_desc:0"Operation Regnmoln, or 'Rain clouds,' is to strike at the German Reich while they do not suspect us. Our intelligence suggests we may be able to hide our intentions. However, our plans will take longer to develop as a result."

SWE_the_atlantisk_vagg:0"The Atlantisk Vägg"
SWE_the_atlantisk_vagg_desc:0"The German idea of an Atlantikwall is an interesting idea indeed. Giving it a Swedish name and implementing it ourselves, however, is an even better one. The defense of our newly acquired lands from the sea is a matter of national urgency. We may have a navy, but protecting the coasts with conventional armies is the way. We must fortify them at once, lest we be invaded from across the seas."

SWE_protect_the_faderneslandet:0"Protect the Fäderneslandet"
SWE_protect_the_faderneslandet_desc:0"It has come to properly defend the land on which we stand. We stand strong, but we could and definitely should stand stronger. Our arms are much better used from the safety of a bunker."

SWE_develop_the_straits:0"Develop the Straits"
SWE_develop_the_straits_desc:0"Our conquests in the South are underdeveloped. Their inclusion in our union, however, is crucial and integral. We must raise them up at once."

SWE_develop_the_new_east:0"Develop the New East"

SWE_develop_finland:0"Develop Finland"
SWE_develop_finland_desc:0"The Finnish lands are quite strong and bountiful on their own, but the Swedish nation is yet more bountiful and fruitful than anywhere else, of course. We may have to bring Finland up to speed."

SWE_seize_the_baltics_desc:0"The Baltic states were once a part of our dominion. It's time we brought them back under our wing. The global situation makes them ripe for the taking. So let it be written, so let it be done."
