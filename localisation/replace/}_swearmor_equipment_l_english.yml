 SWE_light_tank_equipment_0_desc:0 "A purchased tank from Germany in 1921. This tank didn't see any active service, but was used extensively as a training vehicle and introduced the Swedish Army to the possibilities of Tank Warfare. It was armed with two ksp. m/14 Machine guns, and would later be equipped with a French 37mm cannon."

 SWE_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Built in 1931-1935, this tank was created on the request of the Swedish Army by Landsverk in 1931. After lengthy delays, the first model was delivered to the Army in 1935. The tank had 24mm of frontal armor, and was armed with a 37mm gun and two 6.5mm m/14-29 machine guns. Pioneering for its time, it had a fully welded hull. It never saw combat usage and was decommissioned in 1939; tank turrets salvaged from the vehicle were later used as fixed gun emplacements along the Skåne Line."

 SWE_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The m/38, or L-60, was perhaps one of the most influential tank designs from Sweden. It had periscopic aiming, torsion suspension and a welded hull. It was used in the Swedish Army from 1934 to 1960, with about 500-600 vehicles produced. It was armed with a 37mm gun, and a 8mm machine gun."
 SWE_light_tank_equipment_3:0 "Stridsvagn m/41-S"
 SWE_light_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "m/41-S"
 SWE_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "As the Second World War progressed in the 40s, Swedish designers looked to the different designs deployed by different nations to observe developments. A captured Soviet T-34 in Finland generated great interest, its angled armor and strong firepower noted. The effort to incorporate these improvements into Swedish armor designs produced the m/41-S, which was originally meant as an upgrade to the m/41 medium tanks which made up the backbone of the Swedish tank fleet. The project eventually developed into an independent tank design, but only a mock-up was built."

 SWE_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Pvkv IV 'Värjan' (Swedish: Rapier) was a tank destroyer based on the m/38 light tank. Noticing the rapid increases in armor protection in tank designs abroad, the Swedish Army found their standing tank fleet's armament had become lacking in dealing with this increase. In this effort, it was decided to up-gun some existing m/42 medium tanks with the proven 57mm Pvkan m/43 to fill this capacity-gap. This became the Pvkv IV."

Seeing the successes and usage of the German Stug III and Stug IV, the Swedish Army sought to emulate this vehicle type by constructing one of their own. This project produced the m/43, which was constructed by removing the upper hull of the m/42 medium tank, and replacing it with a casemate structure. It would mount a 75mm high velocity gun, and a modest 87 vehicles would be made."

It was remarkable for its unorthodox design, with extreme armor slopes, flexible hydraulic suspension and no turret being features only it would possess among its peers. Other interesting features were its two-man crew configuration, its high reverse speed of 60kph, and being able to be fully operated by a single person. Armed with a 105mm autoloading gun, it was comparable in firepower to most of its peers. 290 were produced, and the vehicles used until 1971."
